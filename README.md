📊 Data Cleaning Tool

Welcome to the Data Cleaning Tool, an interactive desktop application designed for organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data effectively. This project provides a user-friendly interface for handling messy datasets, preparing them for analysis, and deriving actionable insights with the power of Python!

🎯 Purpose

The Data Cleaning Tool was built to simplify the process of:

Data Preparation: Uploading and consolidating multiple datasets (CSV or JSON format).
Data Cleaning: Automating the process of removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in data format.
Data Analysis: Generating visualizations and statistical summaries to derive meaningful insights.
Data Export: Exporting cleaned data to JSON format for further use in other tools or applications.
This tool is ideal for educators, analysts, and data scientists who want an intuitive solution for managing datasets.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍: The backbone of the application.
Tkinter 🖼️: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
Pandas 📚: For powerful data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy 🔢: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib 📈: For creating static visualizations.
Seaborn 🌊: For advanced data visualization with aesthetic plots.
JSON 🔍: For handling JSON data files.

📊 Insights

User Interaction Trends: Gain insights into how users interact with various components like quizzes, lectures, and assignments across different months.
Component Analysis: Identify which components drive the most engagement during the semester.
Cleaned Dataset: Ensure the data is consistent, reliable, and ready for further analysis or machine learning models.
